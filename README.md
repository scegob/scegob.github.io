# scegob.github.io

What I learned

This porject has helped with learning how to use igthub pages. I originally had no idea that github was able to do this. Through codecademy's frontend engineer career path taught me that you do not have to buy hosting to showcase you projects which was a relief. 

What I need work on

I still need more practice using github free hosting. But this project  does work. Go copy and paste scegob.github.io to look at the page.
